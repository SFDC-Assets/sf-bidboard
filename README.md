# Construction Bid Board Demo Component 

This is a set of objects and fields for subcontractors in the construction industry to manage information around projects, bids, and competitors (often referred to in the industry as a "Bid Board")

I shamelessly stole the data model off of this public video by The Hunley Group http://www2.thehunleygroup.com/l/304991/2017-08-10/235xs  who I highly recommend as implementation partners for any customer in the construction space. 

# Installation #
1. Download the package and install into your org. (Please ping me if it's not working!!)
2.  Turn on read/edit access to all the packaged fields AND the lookup fields on the oppty object
3. Add the Construction Job Tab to whatever Lightning App you are using. 
4. Add relevant Lightning Actions to the Construction Job page layout (Log a Call, Email, New Task, etc.)
